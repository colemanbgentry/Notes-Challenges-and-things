    <h5>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h5>
    <p>
      A chapter on newer functions that allow ease of functionality. A different way to call into classes. <br>
      call() -> is a interesting case allowing that ease of calling.<br>
      Rewriting is totally new for me. To change a function after calling it. Odd. 
      All the other items during this chapter will need a re-remember reading definitly in the future. 
    </p>
    <h5>Chapter 13: AJAX</h5>
    <p>
      I remember this from one of my other classes, we touch briefly on it but we didn't go over it too much.<br>
      I'll have to look more heavily into this chapter so that I can redo my todo App once more.
