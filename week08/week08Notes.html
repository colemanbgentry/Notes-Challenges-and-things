    <h2>Week Eight Notes</h2>
    <h4>CH8 - Transforms and Transitions</h4>
    <p>
      I remember transform, I think I had an assignment one time to see what I could do with a red box and use it in an animation. 
      From the example I see that its for the moment just to show that you can move text to have a styled effect.
      Transform does what it means it transforms from the normal and give you a different effect.<br>
      Transitions are fun, I wouldn't mind looking into them somemore. <br>
      Animations is transitions but with more functionality, though I do get the message at the bottom where one should only use it when it is necessary. 
    </p>
    <h4>CH12 - Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h4>
    <p>
      Canvas seems a bit out of the ordinary, but it works I guess. Its like a div from my understand of the section but for iOS. I don't know what I will be doing in the future,<br>
      so I'll take a look later. <br>
      SVG, thankfully I have had a fair share of these when working on my games last semester. I was using InkScape and that was fun. From here I know that we need to create something from
      code now. You get a section set up for it and then fill the area with the shape you desire.
