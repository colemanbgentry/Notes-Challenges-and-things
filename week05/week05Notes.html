    <p>
      I am not a huge fan of error coding, its not my favorite thing. I do see the advantages of error coding and it helps the programmer know where they messed up a bit. I don't use it
      no matter which langauge I use. I know thats not the best method, but its more of a learning experience for me to continue with brute force and get it to work with tons of other code 
      or expand my understanding with a different approuch. Sometimes even taking a break and coming back to figure it out. Or realize that it was super easy and was something just a bit wrong.
      I found this method helps me alot with my game develop skills.
