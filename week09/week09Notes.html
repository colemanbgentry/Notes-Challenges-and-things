    <h4>The Window Object - Chapter Nine of Novice to Ninja</h4>
    <p>
      Its interesting to know that javascript allows global variables, I haven't read that before. Makes sense though.
      It would be fun to see what all the window. functions could do, also with documenut. .
      Now its fun to know what cookies actually are! I had no idea that was what a cookie was, a snack of data from the user. That's crazy, 
      that does require more reading.

    <h4>HTML5 APIs - Chapter ten of novice to ninja</h4>
    <p>
      Now we have the localStorage stuff I was looking for. This is interesting stuff, I had no idea that a brower had this much power to hold information like this. 
      The rest of the chapter continue with this, and what else it can be useful for. Like location services, notifacations, and media. New thing learn today.
