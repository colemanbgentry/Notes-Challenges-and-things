    <h2>Week Four Notes</h2>
    <p>
      <h4>Forms</h4>
        I am kind of familiar with forms we used them alot in the last class for a the main last assignment. 
        Although I haven't seen it in the way that the book has been showing, more directed
        with JavaScript and creating a form with alerts. Which never work for me for some reason. I'll have 
        to dive a bit more into forms but with listeners it seems to work a bit easier than 
        what I was doing last semester. 
      <h4>Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h4>
        Thankfully I have a bit more practice with this in my coding game engine and I use it frequently so 
        hopefully I will be able to pick up on it with JavaScript. Instancing everything is 
        what I do too, its a simplish language but it works. Its nice to know that most languages follow a 
        base pattern and they follow a set of rules together. I'll have to figure out Polymorphism
        Everything else follows more so the same. 
      <h4>Modern JavaScript Development</h4>
        This one I will have problems with, where as I haven't ever touched jQuery before and I'll have to 
        figure out it I can use it. From the reading it pulls similarities from Python with
        its import system. I know the system works like a public library of functions and methods that anyone
        can use and reference. Why figure it out when someone has already. Packages will be something to learn 
        also, something a bit tougher I guess.
