        Refresh on comments again is nice. Its always different everywhere. # is commenting in my game engine, // is here. Always different, its own set of tongues. <br>
        I didn't know that var was in a word discontinued now, and let is now the variable keyword that we should be using. I'll keep this in mind.<br>
        Another thing I found funny with all programming languages is the camalCasing, or the use of under_scores, I have been told a lot of things it always a battle between that
        programming grammer. I do understand the need for a good variable name, its super hard sometimes to make something unqiue when you already used the variable name elsewhere. 
        All fun, all a learning experience inside the bit-world.<br>
        I'll have to investigate the methods a bit, some seem very interesting to learn more about. <br>
        I use a lot of arrays in my game engine for the game I am making, it helps sort things out nicely. Some of the array methods match what the language the engine uses too. GDscript
        is what it is called. <br>
        Sets are something I haven't seen before learning of JavaScript. I'll have to learn more about them soon.<br>
        Maps are different as well. Although Maps and Sets are just fancier arrays.<br>
        Functions are pretty straight forward like all functions are.
