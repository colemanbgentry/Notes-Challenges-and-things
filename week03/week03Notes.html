    <h2>Week Three Notes</h2>
    <h3>Readings</h3>
    <h4>This</h4>
    <p>
       I do remember this from C++. Its like a easier replacement for the object that you want. It allows for simplier functions. From what I was reading, this is powerful
       in the sense of ease for the programmer for a similar result. 
    </p>
    <h4>Novice to Ninja - Objects</h4>
    <p>
        I remember looking at this ahead of time, trying to get the first JavaScript to work. The main thing that I got from ojects in all langauges it allows for a package of information
        to be stored in a library of data. 
    </p>
    <h4>Novice to Ninja - DOMs</h4>
    <p>
      Thankfully I am a bit familiar with these. I had to use them a bit in my first class web development class and it was alright. I will have to get more used to them now.<br>
      From what I can now understand more of is that JavaScript can do much more with DOMs than I thought.  
    </p>
    <h4>Novice to Ninja - Events</h4>
    <p>
        Don't know much about these ones, but its starting to make sense, its like a extension of DOMs that makes the web page more interactable. Also allowing ease of outside forces too,<br>
        like the mouse, keyboard, and screen size. With also using touchscreens, and other phone technologies.
