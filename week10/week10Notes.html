    <h4>Client-side form validation</h4>
    <p>
      Form validation is just making sure that the user enters correct information, like a login and sensitive information correctly.<br>
      There are types, just have the HTML do the work or create everything yourself for customizblitity.<br>
      Using built-in form validation would be the quickest if you just need something fast. Using the required tag inside the HTML, with the pattern tag you can do what you sorta need.<br>
      If one were to use the javascript route they have plenty of room to spread their wings.   
    </p>
    <h4>Using the Fetch API</h4>
    <p>
      Fetch from the reading is slightly easier to use than other methods and has similar results. Allowing the programmer to allow ease of access for all retrieval of documents, forms, and
      JSON.
