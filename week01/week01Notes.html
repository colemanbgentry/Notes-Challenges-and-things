    <h2>Week One Notes</h2>
    <h3>Outside Reading</h3>
    <p>
        To be honest I struggled a whole crazy lot to get this to work. I had to look up everything, especially how to do the script from another page, 
        then I had to go to GeeksToGeeks to get a basic understanding of the array objects and only to be able to piece it together from my game development. 
        That you need to put in the value name to the object names and getting that to work. <br>
        Also getting Github to get the page working was a headache but eventually I got that to work too. Just need a bit of patience, thankfully.

    <h3>Readings</h3>
    <p>
        I started to read EloquentJavaScript, on the chapter Secret Life of Objects, since I struggled this week on them. From the reading I was able to get a understanding of them.
        They are just like how I am using them in my hobby as a game developer. I got a bit more familiarity to them like when I was learning C++ and Python. <br>
        <br>
        Reading the JavaScript Novice to Ninja, was also fun going to their way of telling a object. Having more quirkiness than the other book, using superheros instead of bunnies. 
        I also went to chapter 3, Arrays logic and Loops. Arrays are always fun, and I use them alot in my game at the moment. A bit of a new one was the flattening array, I have never seen
        that before.
